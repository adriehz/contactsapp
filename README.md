# Contacts App

For this week's Encora Academy assignment we had to create a contacts application capable of adding new contacts and update or delete existing ones. It must also be deployed on Heroku.

The required fields for this application are:

Name

Last Name

Email

Company

Phone

And the application must have an API and a Front End component. For this project Flask and Bootstrap were used for said components, with SQLAlchemy for the database.

This version of the application lacks from the specification:

Pagination

Unique Validations

Optional Filter Search
